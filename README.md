##### slack-private-data-connector
# Product Description & Purpose

Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information they need. By bringing people together to work as one unified team, Slack transforms the way organizations communicate. The Slack Private data connector allows you to sync data from Slack such as private channels, messages, threads, and users to Yext on a daily basis. We also use webhooks to pull in real-time updates so any time there are messages, channels or users change, these same changes will occur in Yext.

Pull in users as well as private channels and messages from your Slack Workspace into Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your Slack data even further to power Yext search experiences. In order to install this app, you will need a Slack account and a Yext account. Note: this app is ONLY able to pull in private content and not public content.
